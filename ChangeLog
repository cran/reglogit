1.2-2 (14 Jan 2013)
-----

changed how sparse matrices are specified.  Instead of sparse = 
TRUE, you can just give a sparse X input


1.2-1 (16 Sept 2013)
-----

added save.latents option to reglogit (regmlogit to come) in order
to allow users to bypass saving latents which could cause memory
swapping

added option for using sparse matrices in Beta draws, and now using
rmultnorm for faster samples from the normal distribution


1.2 (24 April 2013)
---

implemented regmlogit for polychotomous regression and 
introduced two new predict functions for reglogit and
regmlogit


1.1-1 (10 Dec 2012)
-----

removed .First.lib in preference for NAMESPACE


1.1 (18 Dec 2011)
